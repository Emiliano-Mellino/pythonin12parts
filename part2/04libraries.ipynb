But you can access thousands more functions from **libraries** that people have created (sometimes called **modules**).\n","\n","A **library** is a collection of functions and other code that someone has created - typically to solve a particular problem. For example:\n","\n","* The `pandas` library was created to solve problems relating to data analysis\n","* The `matplotlib` library was created to add extra visualisation functionality to Python\n","* The `scraperwiki` library was created to solve scraping problems. It's not the only one: Beautiful Soup is another library for this, too.\n","* The `pdf2xml` library was designed to help deal with PDFs in Python (by converting them to xml)\n","* The `re` library provides functions to use **regular expressions** in Python, in order to describe patterns you might want to match (and fetch) in text or webpages.\n","* The `os` library was [designed](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) to add \"operating system dependent functionality\" such as reading or writing files.\n","* The `Scikit-learn` library allows you to use machine learning in Python\n","* The `NumPy` library has lots of functions to do more advanced mathematical processing\n","\n","A good principle to bear in mind when using programming languages is that if you come across a problem, chances are that someone else has already come across a similar problem - and create a library to solve it. A bit of googling around can help you find that, and learn how to use it to help solve your problem.\n","\n","To use a library's functions you need to **import** it.\n","\n","This is done by using the conveniently-named `import` function, followed by the name of the library."],"metadata":{"id":"RQTHBYjsPION"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"aqj0ktsZPHC7"},"outputs":[],"source":["#import the pandas library to use its functions\n","import pandas"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Getting the library name right - and `ModuleNotFoundError`\n","\n","Some libraries have names that you need to be careful to get right.

The `pandas` library, for example, creates a special type of object called a **dataframe**. \n","\n","Objects have properties: a dataframe, for example, has rows and columns, and column names.\n","\n","But those properties can also include **functions**.\n","\n","In fact, strictly speaking, they're not functions: they're **methods**.

By attaching `head()` to `df` using a period, we are asking it to 'call the head function from df' in the same way as we might say 'call the read_csv function from pandas'. \n","\n","This is a bit mind-bending so it may take a bit of playing around to get your head around - and you may find it easier to ignore this piece of knowledge entirely, because it won't stop you using code effectively (I coded for years without really understanding this subtle difference). \n"],"metadata":{"id":"CVAFj7QvbYBh"}}]}
